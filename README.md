## Mockups and Wireframes

Creating mockups and wireframes was a crucial step in the design process for Moodscape. Utilizing Figma, I was able to streamline my workflow by keeping both wireframes and mockups in a single, convenient platform.

### Wireframes

I started with wireframes to provide a clear and basic structure of the website's layout and navigation. This helped in planning the overall design and functionality without getting distracted by colors or images. Each page's wireframe laid out the essential elements, such as headers, footers, navigation menus, and content sections, ensuring a user-friendly interface.

### Mockups

Once the wireframes were finalized, I moved on to creating high-fidelity mockups in Figma. These mockups brought the wireframes to life by incorporating the visual elements, including the logo, brand colors, typography, and images. The mockups allowed me to visualize the final look and feel of the website, ensuring that the design aligns with our brand identity and user experience goals.

## Database Design

For designing the database, I used dbdiagram.io to create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for Moodscape. This tool allowed me to visualize the relationships between different entities, ensuring a well-structured and efficient database schema. The database is built using PostgreSQL and includes tables for users, accounts, addresses, products, images, categories, orders, order lines, payments, and reviews. Below is the ERD that illustrates the database design.

![DB](./docs/database-design.webp)

## Color Scheme

The color scheme for Moodscape has been carefully chosen to create a clean, modern, and visually appealing design. The primary colors used are white, various shades of gray, and an accent color blue that aligns with our brand identity.

#### Primary Colors

- **White:** Used as the main background color to ensure a clean and uncluttered look.
- **Grays:** Utilized for text, borders, and other UI elements to maintain a neutral and balanced appearance.

#### Accent Color

- **Brand Blue:** This accent color is used in the logo, certain buttons, and other accent elements to provide a cohesive and vibrant touch. The specific shades of blue are defined as follows in Tailwind CSS settings:

```css
'blue': {
    '50': '#f1f8fa',
    '100': '#dbecf2',
    '200': '#bcd9e5',
    '300': '#8dbed3',
    '400': '#6ca6c1',
    '500': '#3c7e9e',
    '600': '#356785',
    '700': '#30566e',
    '800': '#2e485c',
    '900': '#2a3e4f',
    '950': '#182734',
}
```

## Fonts

For this project, I have selected the Poppins font. Its clean and modern appearance enhances readability and complements the overall aesthetic of Moodscape.

![Poppins](./docs/font-poppins.webp)

## Logo Design

The logo for Moodscape is a simple yet elegant icon presenting a landscape within a hexagon shape. This design captures the essence of Moodscape brand, symbolizing the diverse and unique art forms. The logo incorporates brand color, blue, which conveys trust, tranquility, and creativity.

![Logo](./docs/moodscape-logo.webp)

## Images

All images featured on the website, including product visuals, are original artworks created by my wife and me. My wife, a talented watercolor artist, has graciously permitted the use of her art pieces for the watercolor products showcased on the moodscape site. I contribute with my personal collection of macro and close-up floral photographs. Additionally, I create pen plotter art, which involves artwork generated through coding in languages like JavaScript and Python, or designed using Adobe Illustrator. This diverse array of artistic contributions enriches the visual experience of our website.

## Icons

All icons displayed on the website were personally designed by me using Adobe Illustrator, ensuring a custom and consistent look throughout. The social media icons were sourced directly from the official websites.

![Icons](./docs/moodscape-icons.webp)

## Pages and Features

Website Header

The website’s header prominently displays the logo, main navigation links, a shopping bag icon, and a login icon. Upon user login, the login icon transforms into a hamburger menu button to accommodate additional user-specific options. To maintain simplicity, a customer headshot is not included; the hamburger menu alone effectively manages user navigation. On smaller screens, the main navigation links collapse into a dropdown menu, optimizing space and improving accessibility.

### Local Development

To run the project locally for development, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the Database:**

   The project is set to use SQLite3 locally. Run the following command to create the database:

   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Run the Project Locally:**

   Start the Django development server:

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

3. **Edit Styling and JavaScript:**

   First, install the required npm packages:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   Make sure your Django server is running at `127.0.0.1:8000`. Then, start Gulp to enable live reloading:

   ```
   gulp
   ```

   Gulp will proxy `127.0.0.1:8000` to `localhost:3000`. This setup allows for immediate page reloads and style updates whenever source files change.

   - Connect your GitHub account and find the desired repository.
   - Enable automatic deploys and select the main branch.
   - click "Deploy Branch."

Your app should now be deployed and accessible on Heroku.

### Load Example Content

To start developing the site with example content, you can load predefined Users, Products, Categories, Customers and Reviews. Follow these steps to set up your database and load the example content.

#### Load Fixtures Locally

1. Ensure the database is created:<br> Run the following commands to create and set up the database:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

2. Load example content:<br> Run these commands in order to load the example content:

```
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/user.superuser.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/user.accounts.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/product.categories.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/product.watercolors.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/product.plotter.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/product.photographs.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/order.order.json
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/product.reviews.json
```

These commands will create the example content.

## Manual testing

### Website Header and Navigation

### Responsive Design Tests

These tests are manually conducted using the Chrome browser's Toggle Device Toolbar to ensure the page elements properly adjust across various device presets.

Test Setup for Responsiveness

1. Open the home page on Chrome.
2. Activate the Toggle Device Toolbar.
3. Cycle through each device preset to check the page's responsiveness.

**What Does "Pass" Mean?** For a page to pass the responsiveness test, it must meet the following criteria:

- Text remains legible and appropriately sized for all devices.
- All interactive elements are accessible and functional.
- Content fits within the viewport without horizontal scrolling.
- The page adjusts smoothly across different screen resolutions.

### Testing User Pages

### CSS Validation

The CSS for my project was validated using the W3C CSS Validation Service online tool. The validation process identified some errors and warnings, predominantly stemming from the Flowbite framework. Most issues relate to vendor extensions, including vendor-specific pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. These vendor extensions are commonly used in modern web development to ensure compatibility and functionality across various browsers, despite triggering validation warnings.

### JavaScript Validation

## Automated testing with Pytest

### Running Pytest

To ensure the reliability and correctness of the backend code, we use pytest for automated testing. Follow these instructions to run the tests:

1. **Ensure pytest is Installed:**

Make sure `pytest` is installed in your project environment. If it's not installed, you can install it using pip:

```sh
pip install pytest
```

2. **Run the tests**

```sh
pytest -rP -v
```

### Running Cypress Tests

To open Cypress in interactive mode:

```sh
npm run cy:open
```

To run Cypress tests headlessly:

```sh
npm run cy:run
```
