# Moodscape

Moodscape is an e-commerce platform designed to offer a curated collection of unique watercolor art, Irish abstract landscapes, floral art, macro photography, digital art, and pen plotter art. This project serves as my final submission for the Full Stack Developer Diploma at Code Institute, showcasing my skills in developing a comprehensive, user-friendly online store.

The platform caters to art enthusiasts who wish to beautify their spaces with exquisite artwork. Moodscape aims to provide a seamless shopping experience, allowing users to explore and purchase art pieces easily. The website not only features a variety of art styles but also focuses on ensuring that each piece is of high quality and uniquely crafted.
