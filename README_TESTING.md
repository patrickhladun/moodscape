### Responsive Design Tests

These tests are manually conducted using the Chrome browser's Toggle Device Toolbar to ensure the page elements properly adjust across various device presets.

Test Setup for Responsiveness

1. Open the home page on Chrome.
2. Activate the Toggle Device Toolbar.
3. Cycle through each device preset to check the page's responsiveness.

**What Does "Pass" Mean?** For a page to pass the responsiveness test, it must meet the following criteria:

- Text remains legible and appropriately sized for all devices.
- All interactive elements are accessible and functional.
- Content fits within the viewport without horizontal scrolling.
- The page adjusts smoothly across different screen resolutions.

### HTML Validation and Accessibility Testing

This section details the manual tests for HTML validation and accessibility. Tests were performed using the W3C Validator and the WAVE tool by WebAIM. Publicly accessible pages were tested using direct URLs, while secure pages (such as account and admin sections) were tested by inputting the source code directly into the validator due to access restrictions.

### CSS Validation

The CSS for my project was validated using the W3C CSS Validation Service online tool. The validation process identified some errors and warnings, predominantly stemming from the Flowbite framework. Most issues relate to vendor extensions, including vendor-specific pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. These vendor extensions are commonly used in modern web development to ensure compatibility and functionality across various browsers, despite triggering validation warnings.

## Automated testing with Pytest and Cypress

### Pytest Tests

I chose Pytest for testing the application due to its straightforward syntax and ease of use. Pytest supports advanced features like parameterization, fixtures, and plugins, which enhance the testing process by allowing for more flexible and powerful test scenarios. It's also free and has strong community support. Throughout the development process, I used a combination of test-driven development (TDD) and writing tests after coding the features. This method helped make sure that most parts of the application were well-tested, making it more reliable and easier to maintain.
