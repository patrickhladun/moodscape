## Mockups and Wireframes

## Database Design

For designing the database, I used dbdiagram.io to create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for Moodscape. This tool allowed me to visualize the relationships between different entities, ensuring a well-structured and efficient database schema. The database is built using PostgreSQL and includes tables for users, accounts, addresses, products, images, categories, orders, order lines, payments, and reviews. Below is the ERD that illustrates the database design.
